# INFORMATION
I have dev a bunch of custom components and you can find all of them on [custom-components repository][1] so track and update them easily.

Compontents that I have developed are the following
 - [file_restore][2]
   
   This is a sensor that reads the last row of a file (vector) and return in state a value of this row that change every hour in a week and an attribute with a vector of all values read from file.
 - [programmable_thermostat][3]
   
   This is a climate components that mange heating system (and cooling in future), according to a sensor value so to let program it during the week. Of course it will allow manage manually change temperature for just 1h or for undefined time.
 
On custom-components repository you can find all the information about them.

## NOTE
All components are available through HACS.
