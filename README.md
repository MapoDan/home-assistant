# home-assistant
Here you can find all the part that I have dev, upgraded or assembled for my Home Assistant

Note that I'm a newbie and not an expert developer, but all the things you can find in my repositories are personally tested and used in my HA istance.

Explore my folders to check my projects! 😁
