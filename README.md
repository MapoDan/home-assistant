# home-assistant
Here you can find all the part that I have dev, upgraded or assembled for my Home Assistant

Note that I'm a newbie and not an expert developer, but all the things you can find in my repositories are personally tested and used in my HA istance.

# IMPORTANT
Be aware that all custom elements that I will create will be available trough custom-updater senor.

I suggest you to check those repository and use the custom-updater component with traking-card. This will let you easily check for update and install new versions available:
 - [custom-components repository][2]
 - [custom-cards repository][3]
